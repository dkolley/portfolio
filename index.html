							<h2>A Computer Science student who has a passion for being at the forefront of providing solutions to intricate puzzles </h2>
						</header>
						<p>Being a computer science student has opened my eyes to a whole new world I never knew existed. What I instantly noticed about my choice of degree is that the more I learn, the more I understand that I have so much more to discover. This is what excites me. My love of the unknown when it comes to technology is what initially drew me to Computer Science and I'm eager to showcase my skills; developing technolgies that have an impact on people world-wide.</p>
