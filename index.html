							<h2>A computer science student who has a passion for being at the forefront of providing solutions to intricate puzzles </h2>

						</header>
						<p>Being a computer science student has opened my eyes to a whole new world that I never knew existed. What I instantly perceived through reading computer science is that the more I learn, the more I understand that I have so much more to discover. This is what excites me. My love of the unknown when it comes to technology is what initially drew me to Computer Science and I'm eager to showcase my skills; developing technolgies that have an impact on people world-wide.</p>

							<h2>Interests:</h2>
						</header>
						<p>Computer Science has many different branches that you can 'grow with' and that's what makes my degree choice so unique. Not restricted by a certain 'branch' at this moment in time, as a first year, I'm still exploring the many different routes and many different areas have already pulled me in. Right now I'm interested in:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>How the application of technology can benefit the financial industry</li>
							<li>Cryptography and the Cyber Security Field</li>
							<li>Machine Learning</li>
							<li>Developing professional applications as a team in professional environments</li>
						</ul>
						<p>Outside of academics, I am an avid football fan. Playing football for various premier league academies throughout my childhood and captaining my sixth form football team, to upgrading my FIFA Ultimate Team after revision. My love for football has been evident since I could walk and I'm also interested in the game development field. </p>
